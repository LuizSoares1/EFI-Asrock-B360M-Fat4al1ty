This is my EFI folder from MB Asrock B360m F4T4L1TY

My pc setting is:

-Asrock B360m F4T4L1TY
-I5 9400F 2.9 Ghz (4.1 Ghz Boost)
-16 GB 2666 Mhz HyperX Dual Chanel
-RX 580 8 GB Asus Dual
-Power Suply Thermaltake Smart Series 500W

Whats is Working?

Everything by the moment.

What i have to do after got this EFI?

We have to get <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS">genSMBIOS</a> to generate our MB serial to use all apple services on system. I recomend that you generate SMBIOS to MacPro7,1 but you also can generate to iMacPro1,1, the important is that it's machine with dedicated video to fix DRM.

My conclusion:

I have use this system 2 months ago, I studied on forums to get my hackintosh more perfect possible and the result is very cool, everything's working perfect to me and I keep gave my hackintosh better than now in the future.
