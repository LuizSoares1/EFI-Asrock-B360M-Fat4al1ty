Whats is Working?

Everything by the moment.

What i have to do after got this EFI?

We have to get <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS">genSMBIOS</a> to generate our MB serial to use all apple services on system. I recomend that you generate SMBIOS to <strong>MacPro7,1</strong> but you also can generate to <strong>iMacPro1,1</strong>, the important is that it's machine with dedicated video to fix DRM. After you get all keys from GenSMBIOS, paste all keys that show's on image.

My conclusion:

I have use this system 2 months ago, I studied on forums to get my hackintosh more perfect possible and the result is very cool, everything's working perfect to me and I keep gave my hackintosh better than now in the future.
